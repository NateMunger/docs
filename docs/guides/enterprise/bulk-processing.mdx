# Bulk Processing

Bulk processing allows executing multiple job definitions across arbitrarily large set of input.
Currently, we have added a feature that enables sending message definitions to large numbers of users in a single API invocation.

## Create a Bulk Job

Bulk jobs must first be defined. The structure of a job mimics the set of available configuration values for sending an individual message.

Request:

`POST https://api.courier.com/bulk`

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "idempotency-key": "rbJ9QDcWn84A-rO94HrbP"
  },
  "body": {
    "message": {
      "event": "my-notification-or-event", // required
      "brand": "my-brand", // optional brand id
      "data": {}, // optional data bag
      "locale": "en_US", // optional
      "override": {} // optional Courier overrides
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": 201,
  "body": {
    "jobId": "1-61e9dd53-b5bb6c863b7ffbe83ad4b28d"
  }
}
```

## Ingest users to the bulk job

Using the job ID, multiple users can be ingested into the job.
Note, the ingestion does not have to happen in a single call, you could have multiple ingestion invocations as long as job is not triggered.

Request:

`POST https://api.courier.com/bulk/{jobId}`

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "idempotency-key": "rbJ9QDcWn84A-rO94HrbP"
  },
  "body": {
    "users": [
      {
        "recipient": "john-001", // optional, auto-generated if not present
        "email": "john@email.com", // optional
        "data": {
          // optional, takes precendence over message data bag
          "recipientName": "John Doe" // optional
          // additional [key-values] similar to /send data object
        }
      },
      {
        "recipient": "jane-001",
        "email": "jane@email.com",
        "locale": "en_US", // optional, precedence over message locale
        "preferences": {} // optional, similar to preferences API
        // additional [key-values] similar to /send profile object
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "body": {
    // gives errors for each user if found any
    "errors": [
      {
        "error": "Duplicate user",
        "user": {
          "email": "u1@courier.com",
          "user_id": "u1",
          "data": {
            "recipientName": "Foo"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    // gives total count of users that were successfully ingested
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

## Executing the job

Once you have added the users to your job, it can be triggered.
Note: a job ID can only be triggered once. If you wish to send messages to more users after the job was triggered,
you'll have to create a new job definition and add the remaiing users to the new job.

`POST https://api.courier.com/bulk/{jobId}/run`

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "idempotency-key": "rbJ9QDcWn84A-rO94HrbP"
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": 202
}
```

## Fetching Bulk Job information

### Job status

- `CREATED` a job has been created, but has not yet been invoked/run. This should be the initial status of a bulk job when it is created.
- `ENQUEUING` the bulk job is currently being processed.
- `ENQUEUED` (aka done) all items in the job have been placed in to the processing pipeline (started)

`GET https://api.courier.com/bulk/{jobId}`

```json
{
  "job": {
    "definition": {
      "event": "V7E6M48EFQMB78H746QCCD1KSRAA"
    },
    "enqueued": 2, // placed on the pipeline
    "failures": 0, // errors during bulk job processing
    "received": 2, // count of users in a bulk job
    "status": "ENQUEUED" // status of the job
  }
}
```

### Job Items/Users

- `PENDING` a job has been populated with the user, but has not yet been invoked/run. This should be the initial status when a user is added to a job
- `ERROR` an error occurred enqueuing the user/configuration combination in the processing pipeline
- `ENQUEUED` the user/configuration combination have been enqueued in the processing pipeline

`GET https://api.courier.com/bulk/{jobId}/users?cursor={cursor}`

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "email": "tejas@courier.com",
      "data": {
        "recipientName": "TK 1"
      },
      "user_id": "kIulr315_od6RBQ0Mp2ED", // recipient
      "messageId": "1-61e9dd7d-13c08339357603322c433d55", // Courier Message ID
      "status": "ENQUEUED"
    },
    {
      "email": "tejas@courier.com",
      "data": {
        "recipientName": "TK 2"
      },
      "user_id": "TCIyZSctsG9Q1zVsZGTGg",
      "messageId": "1-61e9dd7d-87813f6fd7d8f334bbbacbb5",
      "status": "ENQUEUED"
    }
  ],
  "paging": {
    "cursor": "cursor",
    "more": true
  }
}
```

## Message information

This would be just like how a regular /send call works.

Messages are visible on the Courier UI or can be fetched via Messages API.

If you have webhooks configured, Courier will invoke it with the message data throughout the lifecycle of the message.

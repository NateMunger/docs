# Export to elemental

Courier Designer Studio offers DnD functionalities to build notification templates and users can invoke a notification by just referencing the template ID.

Elemental on the other hand offers a powerful JSON based syntax to send notifications.

We also offer interoperability between notification designer and elemental, so you get the best of the two worlds.

Using Export to elemental feature, you can use designer to build notifications and then export it to elemental.

## See it in action

Click the dropdown on top-right of notification editor, and click "Export to elemental".

<Image
  img={require("../assets/guides/elemental/export-to-elemental.png")}
  alt="Export to elemental"
/>

Copy and use the elemental syntax with your requests payload to send notifications.

# Subscription Topics

Subscription Topics are sections where a user can map a notification to a specified topic. For example, welcome and onboarding notifications could be mapped to an `Invitations` topic.

**Please note** that a notification **cannot** be mapped to more than one topic.

### Subscription Topics Settings

You can customize your topic settings like `Name`, `Section` the topic will live in, `Default State` for your topic, as well as `Linked Notifications` to the topic.

### Topic Default State

The Topic default state defines wheter a topic can be opted in or out, and whether it's always required.

- **On:** Users who do not take any action will automatically receive notifications in this grouping.
- **Off:** Users will not receive these notifications unless they change their preferences.
- **Required:** Users will not be able to opt-out of these notifications.

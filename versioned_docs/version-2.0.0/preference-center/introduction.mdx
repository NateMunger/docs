### Preference Center

The Preference Center is what you will use to configure which notification templates to map to the subscription topics you create.
Subscription topics are used to group notification templates under the same OPT_IN/OPT_OUT/REQUIRED configuration.

If your workspace is on ** contract tier ** plan, you can also allow your users to select which channels theyd like to receive notifications
through.

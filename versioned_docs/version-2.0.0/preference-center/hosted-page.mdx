# Hosted Page

The hosted page is an external page that recipients are redirected to where they can customize and set their preferred notification delivery methods.

<Image

  alt="Recipient Preferences Page"
/>

A recipient can select to opt-in or out of a notification (depending on the subscription topic default state)
as well as select the preferred delivery channel for a notification (business-tier feature) from this page.

### Preferences Page Link

When creating a notification template, users can attach a Courier Preferences Page hyperlink that will provide an auto-generated link. This link will open the preferences center hosted page; the recipient will be able to establish their notifications preferences at this page.

Add text to the notification template, highlight it, and select the create link icon.

/>

In the hyperlink modal, add `{$.urls.preferences}` inside the URL form.

<Image
  img={require("../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-hyperlink.png")}
  alt="Preferences URL"
/>

The resulting link will look like this.

:::info User Id

In order for a recipient to successfully set their preferences from a notification, you must include `to.user_id` in the Send request. This is because the `user_id` ties the recipient profile to their set preferences. If no `user_id` is present in the request, the preferences method will not register.

### Customizing Delivery Channels

If a notification template has multiple delivery channels configured, a recipient will be able to customize and set their preferred delivery channel from the Preferences Page.

:::info Business Tier Feature

Delivery Channel customization is a Courier Business feature. Please [contact](https://www.courier.com/request-demo/) our Product Experts for more details.

:::

Once a recipient receives a notification with a link to a Preferences Page, they will have the option to select their preferred delivery channel method. Any further notifications sent to this recipient will adhere by the delivery rules set going forward.

### Preferences Page Branding

Just like with email templates, the preferences page can be customized to fit your [branding style](../courier-designer/brands/customize-default-brand.mdx). The Preference Center will use the the specified default brand to style the Preferences Page.

<Image
  img={require("../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-default-brand.png")}
  alt="Default Brand Selected"
/>

<Image
  img={require("../assets/guides/preferences-ui/preferences-page-branding.png")}
  alt="Customized Preferences Page"
/>

[Developer and Business tier](https://www.courier.com/pricing/) customers have the option to remove Courier branding from their Preferences Page.

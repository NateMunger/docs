# Sections

A Preference Section lets users state which topics a recipient can receive notifications through, as well as setting the ability for recipients to customize their delivery channels.

### Channel Delivery Customization

Channel Delivery Customization gives recipients the ability to select and set the preference for their preferred delivery channel.

If a notification has multiple delivery channels, recipients will be able to set their delivery channel preferences from an external Preferences Page.

# Intro

This is applicable for a very peculiar use-case: Messages that are sent to a list and are shown as a banner via Courier Embedded components.
You'll most likely would not need to use this API unless you're specifically building around this use-case. Reach out to Courier Support if you have any questions.

# PUT /requests/:request_id/archive

<ApiReference {...config} />

# Intro

The Token Management API is used to store and track the status of user tokens. With this API
apps can register a tokens associated with a provider and user_id. Whenever a notification
is sent to that user via the provider, the token will automatically be loaded and used.

With the Token Management API, multiple tokens for a user can be registered to the same provider,
allowing apps to send to multiple devices with a single `/send` call.

Token statuses are also automatically tracked. The API will not send to stale or invalid tokens.

The token management API is all endpoints prefixed with `/users/:user_id/tokens`

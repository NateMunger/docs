# Intro

The Token Management API is used to store and track the status of user device tokens. When a
`/send` call is made with a `user_id`, Courier will automatically load and use the appropriate
tokens. No need to include them in the call.

With Token Management, multiple tokens for a user can be registered to the same provider,
allowing apps to send to multiple devices with a single `/send` call.

Token statuses are also automatically tracked. The API will not send to stale or invalid tokens.

Token Management is all endpoints prefixed with `/users/:user_id/tokens`

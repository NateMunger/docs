# Audit Trail API

The Audit Trail API allows you to manage your [audit events](https://app.courier.com/settings/audit-trail) in the Audit Trail. All Courier business tier customers gain access to a workspace audit trail which allows you to track a wide range of user activity for all members in a workspace. The audit trail will display [supported events](https://www.courier.com/docs/guides/business/audit-trail/) related to workspace authentication, security, and core functionality when triggered.

## Audit Event

The `audit-event` (or sometimes referred to as `audit-event-id`) is an auto-generated unique string describing a particular event in the Audit Trail.

# Bulk API

Bulk processing allows executing multiple job definitions across arbitrarily large set of input. Currently, we have added a feature that enables sending message definitions to large numbers of users in a single API invocation.

New to bulk processing? Check this <a href="https://www.courier.com/docs/guides/tutorials/how-to-send-bulk-notifications/">tutorial</a> to start sending bulk notifications in seconds.

## Creating a Bulk Job 

Bulk jobs must first be defined. The structure of a job mimics the set of available configuration values for sending an individual message.

## Ingest users to the bulk job

Using the job ID, multiple users can be ingested into the job. Note, the ingestion does not have to happen in a single call, you could have multiple ingestion invocations as long as job is not triggered.

## Executing the job

Once you have added the users to your job, it can be triggered. Note: a job ID can only be triggered once. If you wish to send messages to more users after the job was triggered, you'll have to create a new job definition and add the remaiing users to the new job.

## Fetching Bulk Job information

### Job Status

<ul>
  <li>CREATED a job has been created, but has not yet been invoked/run. This should be the initial status of a bulk job when it is created.</li>
  <li>PROCESSING the bulk job is currently being processed.</li>
  <li>COMPLETED all items in the job have been placed in to the Courier send pipeline</li>
</ul>

### Job Items/Users 

<ul>
  <li>PENDING a job has been populated with the user, but has not yet been invoked/run. This should be the initial status when a user is added to a job</li>
  <li>ERROR an error occurred enqueuing the user/configuration combination in the processing pipeline</li>
  <li>ENQUEUED the user/configuration combination have been enqueued in the processing pipeline</li>
</ul>

## Message Information 

This would be just like how a regular /send call works.

Messages are visible on the Courier UI or can be fetched via Messages API.

If you have webhooks configured, Courier will invoke it with the message data throughout the lifecycle of the message.

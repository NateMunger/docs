# Introduction

Courier Sequences makes it easy to define a series of actions Courier should take in response to a notification event or a Courier Trigger(coming soon).
Most notification workflows require specific request and response functionality. Some examples include sending an access approval notification, sending followup messages or sending a custom survey.
These types of request-response use cases can easily be implemented using Courier Sequences.

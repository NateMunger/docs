# Triggers

An Automation Trigger is mechanism to invoke an Automation Run.
Currently only an Automation Run designed in the Automation Template Designer is eligible to be invoked via a Trigger.
There are currently three possible trigger sources that can be configured to invoke an Automation Run, a cron schedule, a Segment event and a Courier Audience event.

## The Cron Schedule Trigger

To invoke an Automation Run on a reoccurring schedule you can attach a Cron trigger to your Automation Run.

1. Select the Start block in the Automation Template Designer and select "Scheduled Trigger"

2. Enter a cron schedule expression to invoke the Automation Run. You can use https://crontab.guru/ to dial in your cron expression. In this example I will invoke the Automation Run every hour.

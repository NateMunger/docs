# Custom Domain Tracking

Learn how Courier can build tracking links with your domain in the URL.

## Using Courier domain for link tracking

Courier uses `ct0.app` as the default domain exclusively for link tracking. If you have enabled link tracking for your workspace, your links would have this default behavior.

## Using yourcompany.com for link tracking

Below steps would require you working with Courier Support and someone with an access to your company's DNS records.

### Modifying DNS records

You'll need to add the following CNAME record entry to your DNS host. This process varies depending on your DNS host.

`<workspace-id>.<your-domain>`

### Courier enabling this feature for you

After updating the record, work with Courier support who will enable this feature for you.

Once its enabled, all links would be routed through your company domain

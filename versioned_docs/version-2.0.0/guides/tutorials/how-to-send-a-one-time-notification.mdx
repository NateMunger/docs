# Introducing Courier's One-Time Send

## What is Courier's one-time send?

Courier's one-time send is a product feature that enables a one time send to be crafted and sent to your users in under 5 minutes.

One-time send is intended to send off messages through one channel and one channel only. If you need to update your users quickly with a notification, one-time send is the tool for you. 

### How to use Courier’s one-time notification feature

Select which channel you’d like to send a notification through. A provider will then automatically be chosen for you. This
 selection is only made given that you have configured providers on your account. From here, write your message, and then send the message immediately or schedule the message for later.

### How do I send messages with the SMS channel?

The SMS channel includes a safeguard for sending messages. First, write out a text message you would like to send to a user. In order to have this message sent, first input text and then hit the 
‘enter/return’ key on your keyboard to *activate* a text. Your UI will have your text appear activated within a blue text bubble. To send this SMS message, after activation, you must then click on
"Send Now" or "Schedule", depending on whether you'd want to send this message immediately or schedule it for later.

It’s important to note that texts are sent in the order of the blue text bubbles. You can delete blue text bubbles as well by clicking on the “x” found within the bubble. We will be 
introducing more functionality to this section in the near future. Below is an image of what it looks like upon hitting ‘enter/return’, *activating* a SMS message.

### How do I change my branding?

Your default brand will only be present within Courier's one-time send. Ensure that you have a **default branding option** selected, this option will show up within ont-time send for you automatically. To change your branding default settings, visit https://app.courier.com/designer/brands. 

Once you’ve created the branding that you’d like to view within Courier's one-time send, then hit the gear icon on the top left to visit the settings module in order to make it your default branding.

From here, select the option “Set as Default”. Note, if you do **not see this option** this means that this brand is currently **set as your default branding**.

These changes will be reflected within our UI.

### How do I add users?

If you’re choosing to send to users via Email or SMS, you can directly write the recipient’s email address or phone number (with area code included) right into the “To:” section of Courier's one-time send and 
ensure that you hit 'enter/return' afterwards to register this input.

You can also add users by visiting our “Users” tab, https://app.courier.com/users. Here you can add users, and create lists, and audiences as well. Once this is complete, these changes/additions
will be visible through Courier's one-time send. Simply search for your recipient and you will see them appear in the dropdown of options.

### How can I start sending Slack and/or Teams messages?

Both Slack and Teams are providers that connect to the Courier app within the 'Chat' channel. In order to start sending messages through Slack and/or Teams, both providers must 
be configured providers. 

https://www.courier.com/docs/guides/providers/direct-message/ on the left-hand side of this link, you will see our Chat providers. Click whichever you need to be configured. Upon configuration, you
will see your configuration appear within Courier's one-time send. 


### How do I preview a message?

Crafting and previewing a message is synchronous within Courier's one-time send. We’ve completely gotten rid of the preview as the message that you craft is what the user will evidently see. Give this a try, 
craft an email message, and send it to yourself. You’ll see that the experience of crafting a message and receiving is quite literally the same. This applies to all channels and hopefully makes your experience much easier as a customer.

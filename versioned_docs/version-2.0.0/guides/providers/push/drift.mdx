# Drift

## Profile Requirements

To start a conversation with a recipient over Drift, Courier must be provided the recipient's email. This value should be included in the recipient profile as `email`.

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    //RecipientProfile
    "to": {
      "email": "example@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Override

Overrides can be used to change the request body that Courier uses to send an email. Overrides are useful when a field is not yet supported by Courier or you would like to override the value that Courier generates. You can override any of the fields supported by Drift’s `/conversations/new` endpoint ([see all send request body fields here](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/creating-a-conversation)). Below is an example of overriding the “send to" email and the access token for the configuration:

```json title=JSON
{
  "message": {
    "template": "<COURIER_NOTIFICATION_ID>",
    "to": {
      "phone_number": "+12345678901"
    },
    "data": {
      "name": "Katherine Pryde"
    },
    "provider": {
      "drift": {
        "override": {
          "body": {
            "from": "+109876543210"
          },
          "config": {
            "accessToken": "<youraccesstoken>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

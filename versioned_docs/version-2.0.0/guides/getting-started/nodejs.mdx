# Get Started with Node.js

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Sign up for Courier to get access to your API key: https://app.courier.com/signup
3. Add the channel(s) you wish to send your message to: https://app.courier.com/channels
4. Install the SDK by running the `npm install @trycourier/courier` command in your project directory
5. Add the following code to your file:

```jsx
const { CourierClient } = require("@trycourier/courier");

const courier = CourierClient({ authorizationToken: "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE" });

const { requestId } = await courier.send({
  message: {
    to: {
      email: "email@example.com",
    },
    content: {
      title: "Welcome!",
      body: "Thanks for signing up, {{name}}",
    },
    data: {
      name: "Peter Parker",
    },
    routing: {
      method: "single",
      channels: ["email"],
    },
  },
});
```

7. Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE` with your API key: https://app.courier.com/settings/api-keys
8. Replace the JSON within the body to match the type and content of notification you want to send.
    There are 4 main properties within this example notification:

    - `to`: provide information used by Courier to identify the recipient of the notification. Here you can include details such as the recipient’s email address for email, phone number for SMS.
    - `content`: add your notification’s title and body.
    - `data`: include any data you want to pass to a message template. The data will populate the corresponding template variables.
    - `routing`: customize which channel(s) Courier will potentially deliver the message. If no routing key is specified, Courier will use the default routing configured in the Courier Studio UI.

3. How can I send to multiple users or contacts?
    You will need to create a list of users in Courier and 
    - Create a list and add users in the UI (**recommended**): https://app.courier.com/users?create-list=true
    - Create a list and add users programmatically with the API: https://www.courier.com/docs/reference/lists/put-subscribe/
4. How can I access user profiles from Courier?
    If you have your users saved in Courier's user database https://app.courier.com/users, you can access them in the JSON:
    - individual profiles with `"user_id": "ADD_USER_ID"`
    - list of multiple users: `"list_id": "ADD_LIST_ID"`

Upon running this API call, only a requestId will be returned.

```json
{ "requestId": "87e7c05b-4f46-fda24e356e23" }
```

Monitor the status of your notification once sent in the Courier app's logs https://app.courier.com/logs.

# Get Started with Node.js

You will need a Node.js project before starting. If you don't have one, create a new project and create an app.js file. This is where you will add your code.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Sign up for Courier to get access to your API key: https://app.courier.com/signup
3. Add the channel(s) you wish to send your message to: https://app.courier.com/channels
4. Run `npm install @trycourier/courier` to install the Node.js SDK
5. Add the following code to your file:

```jsx
const { CourierClient } = require("@trycourier/courier");

const courier = CourierClient({ authorizationToken: "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE" });

const { requestId } = await courier.send({
  message: {
    to: {
      email: "email@example.com",
    },
    content: {
      title: "Welcome!",
      body: "Thanks for signing up, {{name}}",
    },
    data: {
      name: "Peter Parker",
    },
    routing: {
      method: "single",
      channels: ["email"],
    },
  },
});
```

6. Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE` with your API key: https://app.courier.com/settings/api-keys
7. Replace the JSON within the body to match the type and content of notification you want to send.
    There are 4 main properties within this example notification:

    - `to`: provide information used by Courier to identify the recipient of the notification. Here you can include details such as the recipient’s email address for email, phone number for SMS.
    - `content`: add your notification’s title and body.
    - `data`: include any data you want to pass to a message template. The data will populate the corresponding template variables.
    - `routing`: customize which channel(s) Courier will potentially deliver the message. If no routing key is specified, Courier will use the default routing configured in the Courier Studio UI.

8. Run your code. Upon running this API call, only a requestId will be returned.
    ```json
    { "requestId": "87e7c05b-4f46-fda24e356e23" }
    ```
9. Monitor the status of your notification (once sent) in the logs: https://app.courier.com/logs

    - individual profiles with `"user_id": "ADD_USER_ID"`
    - list of multiple users: `"list_id": "ADD_LIST_ID"`

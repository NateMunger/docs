# Analytics

Courier's business tier customers get access to the Analytics dashboard. See stats for notifications (sent, delivered, opened, clicked, errors, etc.) with the ability to filter per channel with customized time windows date ranges. We currently support template-level analytics that lets you gain insights on Send volume and Channel performances.

## Template Analytics (Notification metrics)

This feature gives granular statistical data points on a particular template. You can visually infer how a notification template is performing across multiple channels through a particular time range.

### Send volume

A chart visualization on how the notification send volume has evolved over time.

### Channel performance

A tabular representation of sends, delivered, opened, clicked and errors - diced on channels and providers. This helps excavate ideal channel and/or provider for your notification templates!

### Permissions

Only Administrators, Managers and Analysts would have an access to this dashboard. If you want any custom user roles to get an access, please reach out to Courier Support!
